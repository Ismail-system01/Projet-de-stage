## Abstract

This report details the development of a Pharmacy Inventory Management System, a web-based application designed to streamline and modernize the inventory control processes at [Pharmacy Name]. The primary purpose of this project was to replace manual or outdated inventory tracking methods with an efficient, reliable, and user-friendly digital solution. The system facilitates the management of product categories, products, suppliers, and stock movements, including purchases, sales, adjustments, and returns. Key outcomes include improved accuracy in stock levels, enhanced tracking of product movements, better supplier management, and overall operational efficiency for the pharmacy. The project was developed using the Laravel framework for the backend and a combination of Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js for the frontend, providing a robust and responsive user interface.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Context of the Pharmacy

[Pharmacy Name] is a community pharmacy dedicated to providing essential healthcare services and pharmaceutical products to its patrons. Like many pharmacies, efficient inventory management is critical to its daily operations, ensuring that medications and other health products are consistently available to meet patient needs while minimizing waste due to expiry or overstocking. Prior to this project, [Pharmacy Name] [Describe the existing inventory system briefly - e.g., relied on manual record-keeping, used a legacy system with limited functionality, etc.]. This presented several challenges, including [mention specific challenges like stock discrepancies, difficulty in tracking expiry dates, inefficient ordering processes, etc.].

### 1.2 Motivation for the Project

The motivation behind developing the Pharmacy Inventory Management System stemmed from the need to address the inefficiencies and limitations of the existing inventory processes at [Pharmacy Name]. A modern, digital solution was envisioned to provide real-time stock visibility, automate routine tasks, reduce human error, and provide valuable data for decision-making. The project aimed to empower the pharmacy staff with tools to manage inventory more effectively, ultimately contributing to better patient care and business performance.

### 1.3 Problem Statement

The core problem addressed by this project was the lack of an integrated and efficient system for managing pharmacy inventory. This resulted in:

*   Inaccurate stock counts, leading to potential stockouts or overstocking.
*   Time-consuming manual processes for tracking product movements, orders, and supplier information.
*   Difficulty in generating comprehensive reports for inventory analysis and auditing.
*   Increased risk of errors in medication dispensing and management due to poor inventory data.

The Pharmacy Inventory Management System was designed to provide a comprehensive solution to these challenges.

## 2. Project Objectives

The primary objectives of the Pharmacy Inventory Management System were to:

1.  **Develop a centralized database:** To store and manage information about products, categories, suppliers, and stock levels.
2.  **Implement core inventory management features:** Including adding new products, updating stock quantities, categorizing items, and managing supplier details.
3.  **Track stock movements:** Record all inflows (purchases, returns from customers) and outflows (sales, damages, adjustments) of products with timestamps and user accountability.
4.  **User Authentication and Authorization:** Ensure secure access to the system with role-based permissions (if applicable, otherwise general authenticated access).
5.  **Provide a user-friendly interface:** Design an intuitive and easy-to-navigate web interface for pharmacy staff to perform inventory tasks efficiently.
6.  **Improve reporting capabilities:** Enable the generation of basic reports on stock levels, product movements, and supplier activity (though advanced reporting might be future work).
7.  **Enhance data accuracy:** Reduce errors associated with manual data entry and provide a reliable source of inventory information.
8.  **Streamline supplier management:** Allow for easy addition, viewing, and updating of supplier information, including contact details and status (active/inactive).

## 3. Technology Stack

The selection of the technology stack was guided by the requirements for a robust, scalable, and maintainable web application, as well as the development resources and timelines available.

*   **Backend Framework:** Laravel (version 12.x)
    *   **Reasoning:** Laravel is a powerful PHP framework known for its elegant syntax, extensive features (ORM, routing, templating engine), and strong community support. Its Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture promotes organized code and rapid development, making it suitable for building complex web applications like an inventory management system.
*   **Programming Language (Backend):** PHP (version 8.2+)
    *   **Reasoning:** As Laravel is a PHP framework, PHP was the natural choice for backend development. Version 8.2 offers performance improvements and modern language features.
*   **Frontend Styling:** Tailwind CSS (version 3.1.0+)
    *   **Reasoning:** Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development by composing utilities directly in the HTML markup. This approach provides great flexibility and helps maintain a consistent design system without writing custom CSS for every component.
*   **Frontend JavaScript Framework/Library:** Alpine.js (version 3.4.2+)
    *   **Reasoning:** Alpine.js is a minimal and rugged JavaScript framework that provides reactive and declarative behavior to HTML. It's lightweight and integrates well with server-rendered applications like those built with Laravel, making it ideal for adding interactivity without the overhead of a larger frontend framework.
*   **Web Server:** (Typically Apache or Nginx, as commonly used with Laravel. If using Laravel Sail, it's Docker-based with Nginx.)
    *   **Reasoning:** Standard, reliable web servers capable of serving PHP applications efficiently.
*   **Database:** (Likely MySQL or PostgreSQL, common with Laravel. The project setup uses SQLite for local development as per `composer.json` scripts.)
    *   **Reasoning:** Relational databases are well-suited for structured data like inventory records. Laravel's Eloquent ORM provides seamless integration with various SQL databases.
*   **Version Control:** Git (and GitHub for workflows)
    *   **Reasoning:** Essential for tracking code changes, collaboration (if any), and maintaining project history.
*   **Package Managers:**
    *   Composer (for PHP dependencies)
    *   NPM (for JavaScript dependencies)
    *   **Reasoning:** Standard tools for managing project dependencies in their respective ecosystems.
*   **Development Environment:** Laravel Sail (optional, but indicated by `composer.json`)
    *   **Reasoning:** Laravel Sail provides a Docker-based local development environment, simplifying setup and ensuring consistency across different developer machines.
*   **Frontend Build Tool:** Vite (version 6.2.4+)
    *   **Reasoning:** Vite is a modern frontend build tool that offers fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for development and optimized builds for production. It's the default asset bundler for new Laravel projects.

## 4. System Architecture

The Pharmacy Inventory Management System follows a standard Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which is inherent to the Laravel framework.

### 4.1 Overview

*   **Model:** Represents the data structure and business logic. In this project, Eloquent models (`User`, `Category`, `Product`, `Supplier`, `StockMovement`) interact with the database, handle data validation, and define relationships between different entities.
*   **View:** Responsible for presenting data to the user and handling user interaction. Blade templates (`.blade.php` files in the `resources/views` directory) are used to render the HTML, styled with Tailwind CSS and enhanced with Alpine.js for interactivity.
*   **Controller:** Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. Controllers (`App\Http\Controllers`) handle incoming HTTP requests, retrieve data from Models, process it, and pass it to the appropriate View for rendering. They also handle user input and trigger actions on the Models.

### 4.2 Request Lifecycle (Simplified)

1.  A user interacts with the web interface (e.g., clicks a button to view products).
2.  The browser sends an HTTP request to a specific URL.
3.  Laravel's routing system (`routes/web.php`) maps the URL to a specific controller action.
4.  The controller action is executed. It may:
    *   Interact with one or more Models to fetch or manipulate data (e.g., `Product::all()` to get all products).
    *   Perform business logic (e.g., calculate total stock value).
5.  The controller then passes the processed data to a Blade View.
6.  The Blade templating engine renders the View into HTML, which is sent back to the browser as an HTTP response.
